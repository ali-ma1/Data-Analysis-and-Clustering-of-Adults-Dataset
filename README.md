# Comprehensive Analysis of the 'Adults' Dataset with Clustering Techniques

> A thorough analysis of the famous 'Adults' dataset, conducted as part of a Data Mining project at the University of Wollongong in Dubai.

> Various clustering techniques, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, were used to segment and understand the dataset.

> The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, application of clustering algorithms, and evaluation of the clustering results.

## Project Highlights

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and key characteristics.

> Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for clustering.

> Clustering Techniques:
Application of multiple clustering algorithms to segment the data meaningfully.

> Evaluation:
Analysis of clustering results with evaluation metrics such as silhouette scores and visualizations to assess the quality of the clusters.
